abstract = {Historically, tree biomass at large scales has been estimated by$\backslash$napplying dimensional analysis techniques and field measurements such as$\backslash$ndiameter at breast height (dbh) in allometric regression equations.$\backslash$nEquations often have been developed using differing methods and applied$\backslash$nonly to certain species or isolated areas. We previously had compiled$\backslash$nand combined (in meta-analysis) available diameter-based allometric$\backslash$nregression equations for estimating total aboveground and component$\backslash$ndry-weight biomass for US trees. This had resulted in a set of 10$\backslash$nconsistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for$\backslash$nUS species, as well as equations for predicting biomass of tree$\backslash$ncomponents as proportions of total aboveground biomass. In this update$\backslash$nof our published equation database and refinement of our model, we$\backslash$ndeveloped equations based on allometric scaling theory, using taxonomic$\backslash$ngroupings and wood specific gravity as surrogates for scaling parameters$\backslash$nthat we could not estimate. The new approach resulted in 35$\backslash$ntheoretically based generalized equations (13 conifer, 18 hardwood, 4$\backslash$nwoodland), compared with the previous empirically grouped 10. For trees$\backslash$nfrom USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) plots, with forest$\backslash$ntypes grouped into conifers and hardwoods, previous and updated$\backslash$nequations produced nearly identical estimates that predicted 20 per cent$\backslash$nhigher biomass than FIA estimates. Differences were observed between$\backslash$nprevious and updated equation estimates when comparisons were made using$\backslash$nindividual FIA forest types.},
